# React Bootcamp - Codigofacilito

Here I'll be adding all the files/notes we get to see in the bootcamp sessions.

I highly recommend using the visual studio code extension "Better Comments" by Aaron Bond,
as it changes some comments color.

I think it'll be better to just write everything here in the .md so... I wont delete the js files tho

If you are reading this, it's cause I havent updated it. Give me a couple days pls :]
